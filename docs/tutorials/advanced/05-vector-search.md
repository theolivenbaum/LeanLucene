# Vector search

Dense float vectors are stored per segment with an HNSW graph built at flush time. Searches use HNSW when present, then rerank the shortlist with exact cosine similarity.

## Index

```csharp
var doc = new LeanDocument();
doc.Add(new StringField("id", "v1"));
doc.Add(new VectorField("embedding", new float[] { 0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f, 0.4f }));
writer.AddDocument(doc);
```

All vectors in the same field must have the same dimensionality. Vectors are normalised at index time by default (keeps cosine search cheap).

## Query

```csharp
var query = new VectorQuery(
    "embedding",
    queryVector,
    topK: 10,
    efSearch: 128,
    oversamplingFactor: 2);

var hits = searcher.Search(query, topN: 10);
```

Score is cosine similarity, range `[-1, 1]` (typically `[0, 1]` for normalised vectors).

## Build settings

```csharp
var config = new IndexWriterConfig
{
    NormaliseVectors = true,
    BuildHnswOnFlush = true,
    HnswBuildConfig = new HnswBuildConfig
    {
        M = 16,
        EfConstruction = 100,
    },
};
```

Set `HnswSeed` for reproducible graph builds.

## Hybrid retrieval

Combine vector with text via RRF:

```csharp
var rrf = new RrfQuery()
    .Add(new TermQuery("body", "machine learning"))
    .Add(new VectorQuery("embedding", queryVector, topK: 50));
```

Or add a filter directly:

```csharp
var filter = new TermQuery("category", "docs");
var query = new VectorQuery("embedding", queryVector, topK: 10, filter: filter);
```

## Fallback

If no HNSW graph exists, falls back to a flat SIMD scan. Vector readers are opened lazily, so non-vector searches don't pay the mmap cost.

## Quantisation

BBQ (binary quantisation) compresses float32 vectors 32× into single-bit buckets. The HNSW graph is built over the compressed space, and the shortlist is reranked with exact cosine distance:

```csharp
var config = new IndexWriterConfig
{
    BuildHnswOnFlush = true,
    VectorQuantisation = new BBQVectorQuantisationConfig()
};
```

Int8 scalar quantisation is also available, compressing 4× with a per-vector min/max scale:

```csharp
var config = new IndexWriterConfig
{
    VectorQuantisation = new Int8QuantisationConfig()
};
```

Quantised vectors reduce storage and HNSW graph memory at the cost of a small recall penalty. Use BBQ for disk-bound workloads; Int8 when precision matters more.
